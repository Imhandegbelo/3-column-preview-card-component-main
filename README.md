## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project - as simple as it may look - thought me how to use the CSS Flexbox. I had no knowledge of that prio to this project as I always used bootstrap to simplify things. I'm glad I knnow how to use flexbox now

An illustration of flexbox:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
<div class="big-box">
  <div class="small-box">
    This box is smaller
  <div>
  <div class="small-box">
    Another small box
  <div>
</div>
```
```css
.big-box {
  display: flex;
}
```
